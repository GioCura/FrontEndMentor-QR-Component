## My process

I started with the HTML, keeping in mind the containers that I will use to flex each component.
Then, I focused on styling the card elements so that they will stay centered in the viewport. The paddings were my next concern. I remembered to universally set the margin and padding to 0, as well as to set the sizing to border-box. After that, I played around with the size values of the image and text. Once satisfied, I set the media queries for smaller screens.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned

- It's been a few months since I've started studying web development, but this is the first time I'm doing projects from Front End Mentor. I haven't even used Github before this. So, I've learned a lot.

- I started use this shortcut that I saw in Kevin Powell's videos:

  ex. writing .container results in <div class="container"></div>

  I could shave so much time if I consistently do that.

### Continued development

- I've learned that I'm not yet familiar with all the different ways to center elements in the screen. I instinctively choose flexbox to get this done, but I'm still confused sometimes about setting the widths and heights between parent and child elements.

- Add to that, I'm not confident about whether to use percentage or viewport units (vh, vw).

- A nasty habit of mine: I forget to do a mobile-first approach when designing.
